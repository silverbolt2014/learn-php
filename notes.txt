Q: Do I need to compile PHP programs before executing them, as in Java or C++?
A: No, because PHP is an interpreted language. One advantage of an interpreted language
is that it allows you to make changes to your source code and immediately test these
changes, without first needing to compile your source code into binary form.
Skipping the compilation step makes the development process much faster, and PHP comes with built-in
memory management and caching to negate the effect of the additional run-time load
associated with using an interpreter.

Escape sequences, such as those for line feeds (\n), carriage returns (\r), and double
quotation marks (\"), can only be understood by the PHP parser when they are themselves
enclosed in double quotes. If these escape sequences are enclosed in single quotes, they
will be printed “as is.”

Q: Does PHP support numbers written in hexadecimal, octal, or scientific notation?
A: Yes, yes, and yes. Here are some examples:
<?php
// 8, specified as octal value
$a = 010;
// 1500, specified as hexadecimal value
$b = 0x5dc;
// 690, in scientific notation
$c = 6.9E+2;
?>

Many novice PHP developers mistakenly believe that assigning the empty string '' to a
variable automatically renders it empty. This is untrue, as PHP does not consider a NULL
value equivalent to an empty string. To definitely remove a variable’s contents, always
set it to NULL.

What’s going on here? Well, whenever a form is submitted to a PHP script through the
POST method, the form’s input variables and their values automatically become available
to the PHP script through a special container variable named $_POST. Accessing the value
entered into a particular form field then becomes as simple as referencing $_POST with
the corresponding field’s name,

unset( $variableName ) // this makes $variableName undefined
$variableName = null // this sets the variable to null but the variable is not undefined
